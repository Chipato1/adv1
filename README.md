# Perceptron in scikit-learn
## Authors: David Moreno, Carl Winkler

This project contains the implementation of a PerceptronClassifier model. It contains the predict and predict_proba functions.
The model is tested on the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset. It supports L2 regularisation and Sigm or TanH activation.
The hyper-parameters can be tuned with grid search.
